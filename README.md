Part 1: Job Scraping
This part of the project focuses on scraping job data from Indeed using Selenium Grid, multiple proxies, and multi-threading. It is designed to scrape a large number of jobs efficiently and without IP blocking.

This process is divided into the following files:

app.py: This is the main file. It uses multi-threading and multiple proxies to extract data. It takes two parameters, job_number and num_threads, to control the volume and speed of data extraction.

driver.py: This file is responsible for creating the Chrome driver used in Selenium to interact with the Indeed website.

extract_data.py: This file defines the data extraction structure and dictates what data to pull from Indeed.

create_csv_file.py: This file creates a CSV file to store the extracted data.

output.csv: This is the CSV file where the data is stored.

Part 2: HRflow.ai API
This part of the project focuses on storing the extracted data using the hrflow.ai API.

The hrflow.py file is responsible for this process. It uses the hrflow.ai API to send and store the scraped job data.

Part 3: Deployment
The project is designed to be deployed using Docker, Docker Compose, and an Ubuntu Linux server.

It includes the following files for deployment:

Dockerfile: This file defines the Docker image for the project, specifying the environment in which the app runs.

docker-compose.yml: This file orchestrates the services that the application requires. It defines how Docker containers are built and how they interact with each other.

requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python libraries that your app depends on. When setting up the environment, Docker will use Pip to install these libraries.
